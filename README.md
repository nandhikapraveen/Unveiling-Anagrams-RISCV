# Unveiling Anagrams Using RISC-V Assembly Language

## Introduction

**Project Overview**: This project explores the use of RISC-V assembly language to determine if two given words are anagrams of each other. Anagrams are words that, through rearranging their letters, can form other valid words. For example, "listen" can be rearranged to "silent".

## Project Description

### Objective

The main goal is to implement an efficient solution in RISC-V assembly language that can check if two words are anagrams. This project allows us to delve into the capabilities of assembly language in handling string manipulations and comparisons.

### Methodology

We developed the code to input two strings and process them to verify anagram status. The code:
- Reads the strings into memory.
- Calculates the frequency of each character.
- Compares the character frequencies to determine if the two strings are anagrams.

## Execution and Testing

Tests were conducted with various pairs of strings to ensure the robustness of the solution:
- Both strings are anagrams.
- One pair is anagrams, the other is not.
- Neither pair is anagrams.

## Applications

Anagram detection can be useful in multiple fields such as:
- **Cryptography**: Employing anagrams to encode messages.
- **Word Games**: Enhancing the complexity and enjoyment of games like Scrabble.
- **Educational Tools**: Using anagrams to develop cognitive skills.

## Conclusion

The project not only demonstrates the use of assembly language for handling text but also shows how an understanding of language structures can be applied in computing to solve interesting problems.
